# Binning Process for German Credit Database

This document outlines the binning process applied to specific numeric columns in the `german_credit_data` dataset. Binning was used to group numeric values into ranges, enhancing the readability and interpretability of the data.

## Data Processing Steps

### 1. Data Loading
The dataset was loaded from a CSV file, and the structure of the data was examined to determine which columns would benefit from binning.

### 2. Identifying Columns for Binning
The following columns were identified for binning:
   - `duration`
   - `amount`
   - `age`

These columns were selected due to their numeric nature and a sufficient variety of unique values, making them suitable for grouping into ranges.

### 3. Applying Equal-Width Binning
For each selected column, equal-width binning was applied as follows:
   - **General Binning Process**: Numeric values were divided into ranges, with each range covering an equal portion of the column's overall span.
   - **Age Column**: After binning, the `age` column was further transformed by converting each bin into a descriptive range string (e.g., "20-30"), enhancing readability.

### 4. Saving the Transformed Data
After processing, the binned data was saved to a new CSV file, including additional columns representing the binned ranges:
   - `duration_binned`
   - `amount_binned`
   - `age_binned`

## Summary of Changes
The final output CSV includes the original data along with new columns that reflect the grouped ranges for `duration`, `amount`, and `age`. This transformation simplifies analysis by categorizing continuous variables into defined ranges.
